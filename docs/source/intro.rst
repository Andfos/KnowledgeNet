Introduction
============
``KnowledgeNet`` is a deep-learning framework intended to aid in the creation 
and pruning of Visible Neural Networks (VNNs). ``KNowledgeNet`` was inspired by 
other VNN frameworks, including by not limited to ``DCell`, ``DrugCell``, and
``ParsVNN``. See *Related Works* at the bottom of this page for links to similar 
packages and publications.

``KnowledgeNet`` allows for the embedding of a system within the architecture of 
a neural network. An iterative training and pruning algorithm allows the user 
to sparsify the network down to whatever level is required for downstream tasks.
