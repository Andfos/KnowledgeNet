# KnowledgeNet
Create sparse neural networks to be used as knowledge graphs


## Use KnowledgeNet

### Setup an experiment
#### Setup the experiment directory

1. Create a new directory with the name of the experiment to store the data 
files and results of a particular experiment. We suggest doing this one level 
up from the knowledge-net directory, but the choice of where to keep the 
directory is irrelevant as long as the correct path is specified in the 
config.py file.

For example, we create a `tests` directory in the KnowledgeNet master folder.
